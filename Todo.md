Todo:
* A "view differences" function that uses `git diff` to show changes, active or staged. `git diff --staged` identical to `git diff --cached`
* `git add` needs an "all" option
* Types of settings
    * `git add` needs an option to hide the "all" option
    * does `git commit` get passed `-v` to show the `git diff` in the message editor? 
    * does `git commit` use the default behavior (opening the default editor) or does Gust get the commit name and message internally (default if commit types are enabled)
    * enabling/disabling/editing commit styles
